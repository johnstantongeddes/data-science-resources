# A compendium of useful R packages

Reminder that the [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) are always a great place to start!

General

* [archivist](http://pbiecek.github.io/archivist/): Stores copies of all objects along with their metadata. It helps to manage and recreate objects with final or partial results from data analysis. 
* [callr](https://callr.r-lib.org/): Call R functions in a subprocess
* [future](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/future/index.html): The purpose of this package is to provide a lightweight and unified Future API for sequential and parallel processing of R expression via futures.

Exploratory Data Analysis and Preparation

* [skimr](https://ropensci.github.io/skimr/): A frictionless approach to summary statistics which conforms to the principle of least surprise, displaying summary statistics the user can skim quickly to understand their data
* [vtreat](http://winvector.github.io/vtreat/): A `data.frame` processor/conditioner that prepares real-world data for supervised machine learning or predictive modeling in a statistically sound manner.

Statistical Modeling

* [ranger](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ranger/index.html): A fast implementation of Random Forests, particularly suited for high dimensional data.
* [glmnet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmnet/index.html): Extremely efficient procedures for fitting the entire lasso or elastic-net regularization path for linear regression, logistic and multinomial regression models, Poisson regression and the Cox model. 
* [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html): Fit linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models.  
* [merTools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/merTools/index.html): Provides methods for extracting results from mixed-effect model objects fit with the 'lme4' package. 

Bayesian 

* [brms](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/index.html): Fit Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel models using 'Stan' for full Bayesian inference. 
* [rstan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/index.html): User-facing R functions are provided to parse, compile, test, estimate, and analyze Stan models by accessing the header-only Stan library provided by the 'StanHeaders' package.
* [tfprobability](https://rstudio.github.io/tfprobability/): TensorFlow Probability is a library for statistical computation and probabilistic modeling built on top of TensorFlow.

SM/ML Frameworks 

* [caret](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/index.html): Misc functions for training and plotting classification and regression models.
* [mlr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlr/index.html): Interface to a large number of classification and regression techniques, including machine-readable parameter descriptions.
* [mlr3](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlr3/index.html): Efficient, object-oriented programming on the building blocks of machine learning.
