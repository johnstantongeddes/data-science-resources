# A compendium of useful R packages

Not the popular tidyverse ones, but other less common ones I've found useful

* [archivist](http://pbiecek.github.io/archivist/): Stores copies of all objects along with their metadata. It helps to manage and recreate objects with final or partial results from data analysis. 
* [callr](https://callr.r-lib.org/): Call R functions in a subprocess
* [skimr](https://ropensci.github.io/skimr/): A frictionless approach to summary statistics which conforms to the principle of least surprise, displaying summary statistics the user can skim quickly to understand their data
* [vtreat](http://winvector.github.io/vtreat/): A `data.frame` processor/conditioner that prepares real-world data for supervised machine learning or predictive modeling in a statistically sound manner.
